# HealthCare-Report-Analysis
I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset and built an interactive Power BI dashboard! This project dives into key metrics that reflect hospital performance, patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and much more.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Analyzed patient visit patterns, treatment types, and cost breakdowns

Visualized doctor performance and department-wise efficiency

Uncovered insights into patient age groups, diseases treated, and regional distribution

Built an interactive dashboard for easy decision-making and storytelling

📌 Tools & Tech: Power BI, DAX, Data Cleaning & Transformation, Data Modeling, Interactive Visuals

💡 This project helped me enhance my data visualization skills and understand how powerful data storytelling can be in the healthcare sector.
